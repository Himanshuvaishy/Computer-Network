# 🔌 What Are Ports in Networking?

Ports are like **virtual doors** that allow your computer to **send and receive data** for different applications over the internet or a local network.

When data comes to your computer, it needs to know **which application (browser, game, email, etc.)** should handle it. Ports help route the data to the correct app.

## 🧠 Real-Life Analogy

- **Computer = Building**
- **IP Address = Building Address**
- **Ports = Doors or Rooms inside the Building**

Each application or service runs behind a different door.

Example:
- Web Server → Room 80
- Email Server → Room 25
- FTP Server → Room 21

When a package (data) arrives, the system checks **which port (room)** it should be delivered to.

## 📦 Structure of Network Communication

Every connection includes:

IP Address + Port Number

Example:
192.168.1.10:80

Here:
- `192.168.1.10` → Device's IP address
- `:80` → Port number indicating HTTP (web service)

## 🛠️ Why Are Ports Used?

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Targeting correct app** | Ensures data reaches the right application on a computer |
| 🔌 **Multiple services** | Enables a single device to handle many services simultaneously |
| 🔐 **Security** | Firewalls and routers can control access by opening/closing ports |

## 🔢 Types of Ports

There are **65,536 ports** available:
Range: 0 to 65535

### Categories:

| Range | Name | Usage |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0–1023 | Well-known ports | System-level services (e.g., HTTP, FTP) |
| 1024–49151 | Registered ports | Used by user-installed apps |
| 49152–65535 | Dynamic/private ports | Temporary connections by the OS |

## 🌍 Common Ports You Should Know

| Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 20, 21 | FTP | File transfer |
| 22 | SSH | Secure remote login |
| 23 | Telnet | Unencrypted remote login |
| 25 | SMTP | Sending emails |
| 53 | DNS | Domain resolution |
| 80 | HTTP | Unsecured web traffic |
| 110 | POP3 | Receiving emails |
| 143 | IMAP | Email retrieval |
| 443 | HTTPS | Secure web traffic |
| 3306 | MySQL | Database |
| 8080 | HTTP-alt | Alternate web traffic port |

## 🧪 How Ports Work (Simple Flow)

1. User opens browser and goes to `www.google.com`
2. Browser requests Google's IP and prepares a connection to **port 443** (for HTTPS)
3. The request is sent: `Google's IP:443`
4. Google receives it on port 443 and replies with website data
5. Browser displays the content

## 🔐 Ports & Security

- Firewalls **monitor and block unwanted ports**
- Open ports = **entry points for hackers**
- Only necessary ports should be **open**; others should be **closed**

| Feature | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What is a Port?** | A logical endpoint for communication |
| **Range** | 0 to 65535 |
| **Combined with** | IP address to route traffic |
| **Purpose** | Direct data to correct app/service |
| **Security** | Managed via firewalls and routers |

🖧 What is a MAC Address?
A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network device (like a laptop, phone, or router) by the manufacturer.

Think of it as the serial number for your device’s network card.

🧠 Real-Life Analogy
If your IP address is like your house address,
then your MAC address is like your name on the mailbox — it identifies your specific device inside a network.

📦 Format of a MAC Address
A MAC address is a 12-digit hexadecimal number, usually shown in one of these formats:

Copy
Edit
00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E
First 6 digits → Manufacturer ID (also called OUI - Organizationally Unique Identifier)

Last 6 digits → Device ID (unique for each device)

🛠️ Purpose of a MAC Address
Purpose	Explanation
🧭 Unique Device Identity	Ensures every network device is uniquely identifiable
📨 Local Network Communication	Used for communication within a LAN (Local Area Network)
🔐 Security & Filtering	Routers/firewalls can allow/block specific MAC addresses
🧬 ARP Protocol	Translates IP addresses to MAC addresses so devices can talk on a LAN

🌍 MAC Address vs IP Address
Feature	MAC Address	IP Address
Assigned by	Manufacturer	ISP or Network Admin
Changes?	No (permanent unless spoofed)	Yes (dynamic or static)
Scope	Local Network (LAN)	Global Network (Internet)
Format	Hexadecimal (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)	Decimal (e.g., 192.168.1.10)

🧪 How MAC Works in a Network
You send a message to 192.168.1.5.

Your system asks: "What MAC address is linked to that IP?"

It uses the ARP protocol to find the MAC.

Then it sends the message directly to that MAC inside the network.

🔐 Can MAC Be Changed?
Yes, MAC spoofing is the act of changing the MAC address (for testing or malicious reasons). However, most devices use the original factory-assigned MAC.
