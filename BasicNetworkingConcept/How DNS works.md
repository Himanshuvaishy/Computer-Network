# 🌐 How DNS Servers Work – Simple Explanation

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is like the **phonebook of the internet**. You type a website name (like `www.google.com`), but computers don't understand names — they understand **IP addresses** (like `142.250.195.4`). DNS translates human-friendly names into machine-friendly IP addresses.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step: How DNS Works

Let’s say you type `www.google.com` in your browser. Here's what happens:

---

### 1. **Browser Cache Check**
Your browser first checks if it already knows the IP address for `www.google.com` from a **recent visit**.
- ✅ If found → goes directly to the site.
- ❌ If not found → moves to next step.

---

### 2. **OS Cache Check**
Your computer checks its own DNS cache (stored from previous lookups).

---

### 3. **Router Check**
Your request goes to your **router**, which may have its own cache.

---

### 4. **ISP's DNS Server (Recursive Resolver)**
If no one has the answer yet, your request goes to your **Internet Service Provider’s (ISP) DNS server**.
This is called the **recursive resolver**, because it **does the hard work** of finding the answer for you.

---

### 5. **Root DNS Server**
If your ISP’s resolver doesn't know, it asks a **Root DNS Server** (like the boss of DNS).

There are **13 root servers** globally (named `a.root-servers.net` to `m.root-servers.net`).

- Root server responds:  
  👉 “I don’t know google.com, but I know who handles `.com` domains.”  
  → Sends IP of the **TLD server**.

---

### 6. **TLD DNS Server**
TLD = **Top-Level Domain** (like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`).

The `.com` server replies:  
👉 “I don’t know `www.google.com`, but I know the DNS server for `google.com`.”  
→ Sends IP of **Google’s authoritative name server**.

---

### 7. **Authoritative DNS Server**
This is the **final source of truth** for the domain.

Google’s DNS server replies with:  
👉 “`www.google.com` = `142.250.195.4`”

---

### 8. **Back to Your Browser**
- The IP address is returned step-by-step back to your browser.
- Your browser stores it in cache (to avoid repeating the lookup).
- Then it sends a request to `142.250.195.4` and loads Google’s website!

## 💡 Recap in Short:

```plaintext
Browser → OS → Router → ISP DNS (recursive resolver)
→ Root Server → TLD Server → Authoritative Server
→ IP Address → Back to Browser

 Bonus: What If DNS Fails?
If DNS is misconfigured or the server is down:

You'll see errors like: "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN"

You won’t be able to access the website by name (only by IP if you know it)


🕓 What is TTL in DNS?
TTL stands for Time To Live.

In the context of DNS, TTL tells how long a DNS record can be cached (saved) by a DNS resolver (like your browser, OS, router, or ISP).

🔍 Simple Definition:
TTL is the duration (in seconds) that a DNS response is considered valid and stored in cache.

Once the TTL expires, the DNS client must query the DNS server again to get a fresh copy of the record.

📦 Example:
Let’s say a DNS record for www.example.com has:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
TTL = 3600 seconds
This means:

After the first lookup, the IP address is cached for 1 hour (3600 seconds).

Any repeated visit within 1 hour will not trigger a new DNS query.

After 1 hour, the cache expires, and the system will re-query the DNS server.

🧠 Why TTL Matters:
TTL Time	Use Case	Pros	Cons
⏱️ Low (e.g., 60 sec)	Websites that change IP often	Fast updates	More DNS traffic
🕒 High (e.g., 86400 sec = 1 day)	Static websites	Reduces DNS load	Slower to reflect changes

💡 Real-world Usage
Websites doing load balancing or server migrations may set low TTL.

Stable, rarely changed websites often set high TTL to reduce load.
